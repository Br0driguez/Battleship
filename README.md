# Battleship
Implemented the game of battleship.

<h3> Introduction </h3>
Imitates the popular game Battleship. The game is a simple one. To start with you want the ships to be placed around the ocean but you want them hidden. When a player clicks on a Label, it gets replaced with the image of a hit ship or the image that represents the miss. The program also keeps track of how many misses a user has made. When a ship has been sunk, all of the images of the ship get replaced with the ones that show a sunken ship.
